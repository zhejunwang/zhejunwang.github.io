              “It’s almost like a Shakespearean garden,” said Carlos Cuauhtemoc Tortolero Lopez, the SummerDance organizer from the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE). “We are sort of escaping to this urban dance space. We are almost optimal selves. We are the best we wanna be. We are more courteous. We are more respectful. And you see classes and all racial groups represented dancing together.”

                  Over the 21 years of Chicago SummerDance, the program has evolved into the city’s premiere dance festival for people who want to swing across the floor and even get salsa dance lessons. It’s free in the park every Friday and Saturday evening, and every Sunday afternoon between June 23 and Sep. 10. To keep itself abreast of the changing demographics and cultural diversity, the program tries to present a wider range of dance styles and showcase all aspects of dance, Lopez said.

              “Society changes with the program. The program changes with society,” he said. “It has always been one of the most diverse, if not the most diverse city festivals. There are very few programs where your grandparents and little children can all have fun.”
            </p>

              Initially, DCASE offered a lot more big bands and ballroom dancing in the program. Although some of those dance forms have been kept alive among the generation that is aged and transitioned, the music supporting those dance styles has not been supported by the new generation. There has been a shift in the expectation of what music and dance styles should be presented, Lopez said.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Ballroom music is not right away available or accessible, but everyone’s still doing swing dancing,” he said. “Everyone’s still doing a waltz, a cha-cha, or a tango.”
            </p>

              Miguel Mendez, a Puerto Rican dancer and the founder of Dance Academy of Salsa in Chicago, is one of those dance instructors who have been with the program since its humble start and witnessed its growth. Although he did not see an increase in the number of people coming to his studio after participating in the program, he is still happy with offering the one-hour free salsa class every year.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Look, the beautiful people,” Mendez said. “People love our music. They don’t even speak Spanish, but they love what we do and you know salsa is worldwide now. It’s everywhere.”</p>

              Erica Sosa, a young Mexican-American dance teacher, enjoyed her nights in SummerDance and planned to come to the event with her husband Abraham Herrera every single day this summer.

              “For me, the best part is learning new moves (and) new dances,” Sosa said. “It’s very fun to be outside and dance. And then you (can) meet a lot of new people.”

              On average, 65,000 people flock to the open-air dance floor in the Spirit of Music Garden for SummerDance every year. They come together, happy and unified, Lopez said.
            </p>
            <p>
              “It’s a testimony that these things can happen,” he said. “SummerDance is a great example of free culture programming really bringing a city together.”
